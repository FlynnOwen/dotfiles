# Dotfiles

My dotfiles used to set up a unix-based system.

Note that the OS is automatically inferred at run-time.

If using Ubuntu, requires version >= 22.04.

Setting up:

To setup, and install all required packages:

```
./setup --install
```

To only sync configuration files:

```
./setup 
```
